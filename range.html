            One of the biggest issues with electric vehicles is the range. And a lot of people who own or are thinking about purchasing an EV suffer from range anxiety, especially when thinking about going on holiday by car. 
            On this page you'll be able to read what range you can actually expect from an EV and how the charging infrastructure is in the Netherlands.

            The cars in a &euro; 25.000 to &euro; 45.000 budget have an officially tested range &lpar;WLTP&rpar; between 230 and 400 km. 
            Sadly, this range is not really accurate, as studies show that the average EV is about 19&percnt; less efficient than the official methodology would suggest. 
            The more accurate range would be between 186 and 324 km. Another important factor is that this is the full range of the battery, in reality, you should never drive your battery to 0&percnt;, as that can cause permanent damage to the battery. 
            Personally I tend to not drive the battery to anything under 20&percnt;, further decreasing our range to around 150 to 260 km. As you can see, there is still a massive difference between the range of different EVs. 
            Both amounts are more than enough to go to work and back a multiple times per week on one battery, which is also where an EV shines in efficiency, so you may be able to get out more than the above amounts. 
            When fast charging, the car will only charge from 20&percnt; up to 80&percnt; at the fast charging speeds, this is to save battery efficiency. It also means that when travelling, only 60&percnt; of the battery is available to you, 
            this combined with the fact that an EV is less efficient at higher speeds means that EVs aren't meant for long distance highway travel. So expect the previous range of 150 to 260 km to turn into 112 to 195 km.

<!-- Third article, about charging infrastructure -->

                Charging infrastructure

            In the Netherlands, finding a place to charge your EV shouldn't be too much of a hassle, as the Netherlands have roughly 152.000 public charging poles and almost 5.000 fast chargers, giving them the highest charging density in Europe. 
            It is important to check if your EV is compatible with the charging point though, as some places still have a ChaDeMo charging slot. Currently all European EVs since 2019 use a Mennekes Type 2 to charge and a CCS 2 for fast charging. 
            When travelling outside of the Netherlands, the charging infrastructure becomes worse. The charging infrastructure in the Flemish part of Belgium, the north of France and Germany is still serviceable though. 
            Almost all European countries are trying to improve their charging infrastructure, so expect this to get better over time. When travelling with an EV, it is always advised to plan out your route beforehand, especially when going through other countries. 
            Calculate the maximum range you feel comfortable with driving in an EV and looks for charging stops. Fast Charging does not take long, usually you're back to 80&percnt; charge within 20 minutes. For me personally the wait has never been an issue, as it forces me to take breaks between driving. 
            Personally I can really recommend the Fastned Network, as they have transparent prices, great coverage, an easy to use app and their stations are generally very reliable.
