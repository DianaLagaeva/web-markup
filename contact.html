                My name is <em>Jeroen van der Valk</em>. I am studying at the university of InHolland. At the time of writing this article I am 23 years old. As with most people my age, I worry about the future of my generation, especially with respect to the ever present threat that climate changes poses, this is also one of the main reasons I wanted to look if an EV was a viable option for me.

                Back in 2023 my brother and I wanted to buy our first car. While looking at cars to buy, I researched almost every single aspect of EVs in great detail, also to prepare myself for how driving an EV would truly be.
                Eventually we ended up buying a 2020 (30th of December) fully electric Opel Corsa. Iâ€™m incredibly happy with the car, I have even driven it to Paris and back to the Netherlands. If I had the choice, I would definitely buy it again.

                When I was researching cars, however, I realized how difficult it was to find concise information about EVs, how many stigmas, and legitimate concerns there are around EVs, which is why I have made this website.
