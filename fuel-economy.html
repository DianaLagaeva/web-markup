                Difficult to compare
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p> The fuel economy of an electric car and a gasoline powered car are not easily comparable. As there are many factors that influence the price per kilometre, such as the price of electricity or where you charge your car. We'll go over the two main factors here:</p>

            <h3>
                The efficiency of an electric car and a gasoline powered car
            </h3> 
        </header>
        <p>
            According to data from 2023 in the Netherlands the average electric car has a fuel efficiency of 17 kWh/100 km WLTP, according to research in the real world this efficiency is closer to 21 kWh/100 km.
            As for petrol powered cars, according tot he same research paper the average efficiency of a gasoline powered car is 5,91 l/100 km WLTP, just like with electric cars the efficiency in the real world is different, measuring closer to 6,67 l/100 km.
            To see which car is cheaper to drive, we'll use the real world values, as people generally don't drive their car in labs.

            <h3>
                The prices of electricity and fuel
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            Another main factor is the price of electricity and the price of fuel. For electric cars, it is a lot cheaper to charge your car at home compared to a public charging solution, however this is not an option for everyone, which is why I have included both prices when charging at home and prices for charging at a public charging pole.
            According to the CBS, in the first quarter of 2024 the average price of one litre of gasoline was € 1,964.
            According to that same graph, the average price of one kWh at a public charging pole was € 0,457.
            According to the CBS, in the first quarter of 2024 the average price of one kWh of electricity was € 0,3291, this is our price per kWh when charging at home.

<!-- fourth article, the conclusion -->

            <h3>
                What is cheaper
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            Using the numbers above, the average gasoline car costs € 13,10 per 100 km.
            The average electric car costs € 9,60 per 100 km when charging in public, or just € 6,91 per 100 km when charging at home.
            According to the CBS the average person drives about 12.000 km per year.
            When driving that amount per year, you would save €420,00 per year when charging in public, or € 742,80 per year when charging at home.
