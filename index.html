            <p>
                An increasing amount of laws are being introduced to restrict or outright ban ICEs due to various environmental reasons, making EVs seem like they are the future. Even more so because EVs as technology are incredibly new compared to ICE vehicles.
                A car is already one of the most expensive single purchases and an EV is even more expensive than an ICE vehicle, but can an EV make up for that price difference? Is it cheaper to fuel an EV or a gasoline powered car?

                For all calculations on this website I assume the following:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    An original total car price between € 25.000 and € 45.000 (more on how to buy an EV cheaper here);
                </li>
                <li>
                    A battery capacity between 40 and 60 kWh.
                </li>
